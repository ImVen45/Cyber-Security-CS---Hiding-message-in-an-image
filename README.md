## Project Summary: Image Steganography using Python

**Project Objective:** This project implements a Python program that can embed and extract secret messages within images using a simple steganographic technique called Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding.

**Key Features:**

* The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages.
* Messages are converted to binary format before embedding into the image pixels.
* A password is used for decryption to protect the hidden message.
* The process is user-friendly with a simple menu-driven interface.

**Technical Details:**

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries used: OpenCV, NumPy
* Steganography Technique: LSB Encoding

**Project Workflow:**

1. The user chooses to encrypt or decrypt a message.
2. For encryption:
    * User enters the message and password.
    * Message is converted to binary format.
    * Binary message is embedded into the image pixel values.
    * Encrypted image is saved and displayed.
3. For decryption:
    * User enters the password.
    * Embedded binary message is extracted from the image.
    * Binary message is converted back to text and displayed.

**Benefits:**

* Provides a simple and effective way to hide messages within images.
* Offers a password protection mechanism for secure decryption.
* Useful for educational purposes to understand steganography principles.

**Limitations:**

* The encryption method is relatively simple and can be broken with advanced techniques.
* The maximum message length is limited by the available image size.
* The password security relies solely on the user's choice, which can be weak.

**Future Enhancements:**

* Implement more robust encryption algorithms.
* Utilize advanced embedding techniques for better security.
* Integrate image preprocessing steps to reduce distortion.
* Develop a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.

**Overall, this project demonstrates a basic implementation of steganography using Python. It serves as a good starting point for further exploration and development of more advanced techniques.**
